GITHUB

HOW TO PUSH 
You would first need to know which master you are on then you type **ls(list)**- this list all the folders 
**cd **then file name -you will type it out a bit and then click tab it finishes the sentence for you
**ls **again to list files then tab for the file you want.
**ls **again to see if thats the file you want.now that all that is done you enter
YOU want the local file to now be initialised as a git file so you type** git init **then enter
if you look at the files now they will hav a //.git file//--files are succesfully initialised how to look?
**ls -al **this list all the files even the hidden files thats where you will see the git file
Now type git status to see the status of your files ,this will show you if commits have made the branch master
Now we add the git files on our local git wit command ** git add .**
**git status** shows you what you want to commit  basically the status of your file
**git commit -m** now we commiting changes on our local pc
***git log*****  would show you the history of your commits
** git remote add +link of repo *** now we trying to link the local file to the remote hub//to the cloud
** git remote add name** so now you naming the link of repo because you can link the local repo multiple remote repo's
** git pull name**  you cannot pushh without pulling when there are changes/ conflict and --but you are pulling first because it will override the existing files if you do not pull current info
** git pull name main**  changing local files branch to main fom master
** git pull name main --allow-unrelated-histories***
** git branch **** cheching if branch is master or main
** git bracnch -m main ***
** git branch*** returns value main as it has been changed from master to main
** git push --set upstream branch name main**
